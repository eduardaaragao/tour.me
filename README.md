I bet whenever you travel some place new you do the famous Google search: what to do in x.

Yes, we know how daunting the task of planning your whole trip is. This is why Tour.me helps you to find a local native to show you the city around.
But that's not just it. 

He/she will also provide you accommodation during your stay, so it's the perfect combo. You type the place you want to go, talk to your guider
and voil√†. They'll have your trip planned to visit the most attractive places in town.

This solution is a go-to for:

- Students who travel on a budget
- People who spend low periods of time travelling (3 to 5 days)
- Socially open people who want to learn the culture by the eyes of a local native!
